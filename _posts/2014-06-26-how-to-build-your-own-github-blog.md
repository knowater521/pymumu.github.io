	> **https://github.com/`username`/username.github.io/generated_pages/new**
3. Clone your repository to local.
4. Write your blog file named `YYYY-MM-DD-blog-title.md`. and put it in _posts directory, the syntax of blog is markdown.
5. Push it to github server.
6. You can access you website at `http://yourname.github.io.` (The server will take some minutes for the first publish)

## How-to
### About Front-matter
Any file that contains a YAML front matter block will be processed by Jekyll as a special file.

You can learn more about YAML Front Matter at http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/.

### Front-end framework. 
Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework, You can use it to design your website in your own style.

Here are some example pages.

You can use them as your templete pages.

### Display blog posts.

### Some other components you may need.
* jquery : http://jquery.com/

### Add comments system 
There are many comments systems, I prefer [Disqus](https://www.disqus.com/)

If your blog is in Chinese, you can use [多说](http://www.duoshuo.com/) as your comments system.
